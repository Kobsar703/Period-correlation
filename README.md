# Period-correlation
The main objective of this program is to find the best correlation for the magnetic field and photometry observed by the Space Telescope TESS. For the best correlation and anti-correlation, it defines the period of rotation of the star. To use, you need to fill in the fields respectively, the name of the folder where the files are located (if you created any), the file name for the photometry, for the magnetic field, the limits for the period, if you can assume an approximate value and the number of points you want to try between them. In the case that I add, the period is about 2,888 days, (read the names for files, please). So, to save your time and you understand better how it's working, I propose: limits for the period are 2.80 and 3.00,  points between are 200. Changing some parameters you will see the difference. Some images will be saved after the compilation and some you will save by yourself if you need any.
